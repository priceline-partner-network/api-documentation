#### Interline
Interlining agreements differ from codesharing agreements in that codesharing agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) even though the flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued. Both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued. Interline agreements are directional. For example it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an AmericanoUnited itinerary but United might not be able to be issuer on the same itinerary.

#### Marketing Carrier
Many airlines enter into codeshare agreements where an airline will sell and market a flight as its own when in fact the flight is operated by another airline.

#### Merchant of Record (MOR)    
The company that executes the credit card transaction, ie charges the customer.

#### Merchant rates

#### Non-Stop Flight

#### Open Jaw
The destination of the outbound flight is not the origin point of the return flight or where the destination of the return flight is not the origin point of the outbound flight.

#### Operating Carrier
Many airlines enter into codeshare agreements where a flight is sold and marketed by carrier YY but is actually operated by carrier XX. E.g. Continental markets flight 7519 from Boise to Denver as a Continental flight, however, the flight is operated by United Airlines. It will have United logos on the plane and the flight crew will be United.

- Multi Destination/Open Jaw – A to B, then C to D (e.g. JFK-LAX, SFO-JFK)

#### Refund
A ticket has been issued and the consumers credit card has been charged. A refund reverses this process. It refunds the customers card and reverses the ticket sale with the airline.
