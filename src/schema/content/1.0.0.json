Collision Damage Coverage can be purchased for only $9/calendar day for standard rentals (with $40,000 in coverage), or $12/calendar day for premium rentals (with $75,000 in coverage). Please remember, while no payment is required for your rental car reservation until you pick up the vehicle, Collision Damage Coverage is charged immediately to your credit card at the time of booking your reservation, or when you add it to your existing reservation. \n[[breakline]]\n[[breakline]]\nWhile the vehicle is in your possession and is damaged due to collision, theft, vandalism, windstorm, fire, hail or flood, you are subject to pay a lesser amount for the total cost of car repairs, additional charges imposed by the rental car company, or the actual cash value of the car. The coverage offered on our website provides a cost-effective way to protect yourself against unforeseen damages or theft. There is also no deductible. \n[[breakline]]\n[[breakline]]\nThe plan is primary coverage, meaning you do not have to claim payment from any other insurance plan before receiving coverage under this plan. This helps avoid filing a claim with your personal auto insurance and risking insurance rates increasing in the future. This coverage is very similar to the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) that the car rental companies try to sell customers at the time of renting a car. Like the CDW, this coverage provides reimbursement to the person purchasing the plan for charges incurred due to loss or damage of the rental car. It is possible that agents at the counter may try to sell you their plan. Please note that while this coverage is similar to the CDW offered by the rental car companies, certain benefits, limits, terms and exclusions may differ.\n[[breakline]]\n[[breakline]]\nIf you have additional questions about Collision Damage Insurance Coverage, contact Allianz Global Assistance, our partner and insurance provider, at 1 (866)909-4101 or learn more at <a href='www.etravelprotection.com/ppn/home'>www.etravelprotection.com/ppn/home</a>.\n[[breakline]]\n[[breakline]]\nTerms, conditions, and exclusions apply.

Your credit card issuer is also responsible for initiating the process to validate and refund or reverse the unauthorized charges on your credit card.
