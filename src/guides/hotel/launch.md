Partners who join the Priceline Partner Network to sell inventory are required to meet certain display and technical requirements. Prior to the production launch of Priceline inventory, Priceline must certify and sign off that all requirements outlined in this document, and other documents as specified, have been met.

These documents contains screenshots for illustration purposes only. The actual design of the pages is up to the partner; however, the required elements described below must be included in the design. Partners are encouraged to review the [ppndemo.com](http://www.ppndemo.com) website to better understand the requirements below.

## API Usage

* Partners must use all the content provided by the hotel API feed, this includes but is not limited to rate information, hotel name/address, hotel details such as descriptive information, star rating, a list of nearby attractions, a list of directions from different points of interest, a list of the property’s amenities, etc.
* It is expected that all hotel content presented by the partner will be the most current and up to date. The partner will be responsible for all associated costs as a result of stale content.
* The partner is required to use the most current PPN assigned hotel star rating and may not change or display an alternate or old rating.
* The partner is expected to present the most current hotel images from getPhotos and may not house image links.
* Forward distribution of hotel inventory and content by the partner is not allowed, unless with previous consent.

## Business Rules

* Rooms must be reserved under the name of the person checking into the room.
* The reservation holder must be 21 years of age or older.
* There can be up to 4 rooms booked on the same reservation request (same room types only). If there aren’t enough rooms available at the time of booking, the reservation request will return an error. The card will not be charged.
* Availability searches can be performed for 1 room type only. This is a GDS limitation, they cannot respond with how many rooms are left for a given room type.
