* **Codeshare**:  must display the operating and marketing carrier of a flight.  Below are important notes regarding codeshare disclosures:
  The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Aviation Enforcement Office has provided guidance to airlines and ticket agents about the requirement for notifying passengers if a flight they are selling is being operated under a code-sharing arrangement. The new law makes it clear that when a consumer requests an airline itinerary on the Internet, any code-sharing arrangement must be included on the same screen and next to the itinerary. Under the existing Department rules, code-share disclosure must include the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the flight is offered to the public. Disclosure through a hyperlink or when one passes the cursor over a link (“ALT Text”) is not considered compliant with new law. This guidance applies to all pages that reference flight itineraries, such as Fare Results, Details, Contract, etc.
* Notify and highlight if a flight is **overnight** with next day arrival
* If there is a **connection**, name the intermediate connecting airport 
* If a **direct flight** (1 or more stops, no change of plane), disclosure of **stop** is required
* **Long connection** – advise/warn a consumer that their time at a connecting city is extensive.  
* **Interairport** connection – both a warning and highlighting – e.g. flight from New York JFK arrives in Paris – Charles de Gaulle but connects to a flight leaving from Paris – Orly.
* **Open Jaws** – both highlight and provide a warning that the return flight leaves from a different airport then the arrival.
* **International connection**  -  customer should be made aware if a connection is in a foreign  country.  They may not need a visa for the origin or the destination but it is possible that they need a visa for the intermediate/connecting country.

## Contract Page

The contract page is the last step before the reservation is made.  It must clearly display what the consumer agreed to purchase, the name & preferences of the passenger, the billing information, the agreed charges, and the credit card to be used.

#### Business Rules

* Interline itineraries will be charged an extra $7 USD, this fee is non-refundable (even if the ticket is voided).

#### Whitelabel Solution
The API can be used to display availability and at the point where an itinerary is selected, but the user can be directed to our white label (secure.rezserver.com) to complete the booking. The Contract Page up to Confirmation Page and Confirmation Email can be under the white label solution. This allows the developer to take advantage of our white label book path, which is regularly maintained and is up to standard.

In all of our api [availability calls](https://priceline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PPN/pages/42106995/Example+Calls), we return a node called **contract_page_url**, which is a url encoded string that can be browsed to. All connections to this partner should remain the same with the use of the **refid** which should have your branding on configured on our white label for seamless customer experience.

Should the Contract Page be built by the partner, a well-formed contract page should contain the following information:

#### Trip Summary
Complete details of the itinerary (airports, dates, carrier(s), cabin class, fare, fare rules,  etc.)
The fare rules must be made available on this page. It can be with the trip summary, ticket information or in the important information section.  
  **Passenger and Ticket Information**
  Name of passenger, seat preferences, meal preferences (if any) and notification of ticket type.

The following rules apply:
1. Duplicate passenger names are not allowed (identical First/Middle/Last/Suffix entries)
2. Full names are required (at least first and last) 
3. All name fields for the ticket must match the Id/Passport the consumer will use at the airport (First Name, Middle name, Last name, Suffix).
4. TSA Secure Flight information must be collected  for each passenger (DOB and gender)

#### Summary of Charges

A line by line explanation of the charges the customer will receive.  Below is an example of the summary of charges section on the PPN whitelabel.

![Air Summary of Charges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/priceline-partner-network/api-documentation/master/src/assets/Launch%20Requirements/Contract%20Page%20-%20Air%20-%20Summary%20of%20Charges.png)

#### Important Information
Contains important disclosures that the customer must know about prior to making the purchase.  These bullets must be shown to the customer on the contract page.
