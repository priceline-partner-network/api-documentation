Terminology
---------------

## Agency rates    
Rates provided by the hotel that are publicly available (a.k.a. “rack rate”). The hotel will be the merchant of record for these reservations, as they are paid at the hotel. 

## Codeshare
A flight is operated by more than one carrier.

## Connection
A change of planes at an intermediate point between origin and destination with no stopover at the intermediate point. E.g. – outbound journey is from Pittsburgh to Santa Barbara. Flights operate -Pittsburgh to San Francisco - United flight 495. Connecting in San Francisco - to UA flight 6846 to Santa Barbara.

## Private Rates
Private Rates

## Direct Flight
A flight makes a stop at an intermediate point between origin and destination with no connection (change of planes). Typically, but not always, presented as the same flight number on all legs. E.g. - outbound journey is from Pittsburgh to Santa Barbara. Flights operate -Pittsburgh to San Francisco - United flight 495, continuing on using the same flight number and aircraft to Santa Barbara.

## Fare Rules and Restrictions
Every itinerary price has an associated fare. Every fare has a multitude of rules of use including:
- Days of week of travel – it may be a different fare/price on Sunday vs. Tuesday,
- Number of days advance purchase required – how many days before departure must you buy your ticket
- Refundable yes/no – in general cheaper fares/prices charge fees for cancellations or changes whereas expensive fares/prices you can change without penalty.
- Routing – see definitions

## Guarantee Policy    
The guarantee policy describes what the hotel needs to secure the room. In some cases a hotel requires full payment, in others a partial deposit, and in others just a credit card number. The amount varies and is dependent on the type of rate.

## Infants
Children under 2 years of age.

## Interline
Interlining agreements differ from codesharing agreements in that codesharing agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) even though the flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued. Both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued. Interline agreements are directional. For example it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an AmericanoUnited itinerary but United might not be able to be issuer on the same itinerary.

## Marketing Carrier
Many airlines enter into codeshare agreements where an airline will sell and market a flight as its own when in fact the flight is operated by another airline.

## Merchant of Record (MOR)    
The company that executes the credit card transaction, ie charges the customer.

## Public rates  
Rates provided by the hotel that require payment at the time of purchase.
- Agoda.com
- Priceline.com (Public, Private/Express)

## Non-Stop Flight
An itinerary with no stops between origin and destination.

## Open Jaw
The destination of the outbound flight is not the origin point of the return flight or where the destination of the return flight is not the origin point of the outbound flight.

## Operating Carrier
Many airlines enter into codeshare agreements where a flight is sold and marketed by carrier YY but is actually operated by carrier XX. E.g. Continental markets flight 7519 from Boise to Denver as a Continental flight, however, the flight is operated by United Airlines. It will have United logos on the plane and the flight crew will be United.

## Stops
1 or more stops but no change of planes

## Ticket Types
- Round Trip – A to B and back to A e.g. New York – Los Angeles – New York
- One Way – A to B e.g. Los Angeles - Phoenix
- Multi Destination/Multiple Stops – A to B, B to C, C to D, E to F etc. --- max 5
- Multi Destination/Open Jaw – A to B, then C to D (e.g. JFK-LAX, SFO-JFK)

## Refund
A ticket has been issued and the consumers credit card has been charged. A refund reverses this process. It refunds the customers card and reverses the ticket sale with the airline.

## Routing
The listing of permissible cities allowed as connection points between an origin and a destination.
- Example 1: a logical routing would be TORONTO – NEW YORK – ORLANDO
- Example 2: an illogical routing (and therefore NOT included in a routing) would be TORONTO – VANCOUVER – ORLANDO. You would not be allowed to connect in Vancouver on a flight from Toronto to Orlando.

## Schedule Changes
A normal airline practice of changes to flight times, flight number, type of aircraft, number of stops. Airlines send the changes through to the booking agency via the GDS and the booking agency advises the consumer of their new times etc. usually via an e-mail.

## TSA SecureFlight
A mandatory collection of name, date of birth and gender information which is cross-checked against a NoFly list maintained by the TSA.(US Transportation Security Administration) The airline is given authority to issue boarding passes only upon clearance from the TSA.

## Unrestricted fares
Are those fares which do not have penalties to cancel or change, advance purchase requirements, flight restrictions or a minimum stay at the destination.
