## Fare Families Now Available on our White Label

#### What is it?
Fare families are groups of fares offered by airlines with different levels of amenities based on a travellers personal travel preferences. These include amenities such as including a checked bag, flexible cancellation policies, extra legroom, and seat selection. PPN has implemented the ability for a customer to choose these fares on the White Label, giving your customers the opportunity to pick the flight that best suits their travel needs.

The following is an example of the fare family options available for a Delta flight:
