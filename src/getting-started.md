### 4. Build your site or application

Integrate dynamic hotel, rental car and flight data from multiple sources directly into your website or application.

### 5. Have us review your work

Partners who are going to sell our travel inventory are required to meet certain display and technical requirements. Prior to the production launch Priceline must certify and sign off that all requirements outlined in this document have been met.

### 6. Launch your site

Once your site or application has launched our team is still available for ongoing support. Our Back Office tool can provide sales information or custom reports on how your application is performing.
